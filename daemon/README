Introduction
------------

SFLPhone is a Voice-over-IP software phone. We want it to be:
- user friendly (fast, sleek, easy to learn interface)
- corporate grade (transfers, holds, perfect audio quality)
- fully compatible with Asterisk (SIP and IAX protocols)
- customizable 

As the SIP/audio daemon and the user interface are separate processes,
it is easy to provide different user interfaces. SFLPhone0.8 comes with
a GTK graphical user interface, an interactive command line interface,
and even scripts to control the daemon from the shell.

SFLPhone is actually used by the support team of Savoir-Faire Linux Inc.

More information is available on the project homepage:

Short description of content of source tree
-------------------------------------------

- ringtones/ contains the different ringtones.
- stund/ is an implementation of the protocol STUN used when there is a NAT.
- utilspp/ allows to implement a singleton.
- src/ is the core of SFLphone. It contains the main.cpp, managerimpl.cpp
  files, audio and gui directories, and files about signalisation SIP. Later,
  it should be better, when IAX will be implemented, that a directory groups
  these protocols. 
  The ManagerImpl class is the intermediaire between all the layer in the tree.
- src/audio/ is the audio layer. It contains all about tones, dtmf,
  audiodriver, rtp layer, audio codec ulaw, alaw and gsm.
- src/dbus, the dbus xml interfaces, and c++ bindings

How to compile
--------------

# First compile the SIP library
cd libs/pjproject-1.0.3
./autogen.sh
./configure --disable-ilbc-codec && make clean && make dep && make
sudo make install

If you already have installed a different version of 
pjsip on your system, you will most likely have some errors
such as :

"ln: creating symbolic link `./libpjsip-sfl.a': File exists"

after executing make install.

Simply remove those files and run "make install" again.

# Then the daemon
cd ../..
./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --with-debug
make
sudo make install

# And the GNOME client
cd sflphone-client-gnome
./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --with-debug
make
sudo make install

 Done !

Free SIP/IAx2 accounts
---------------------

You may create a free SIP/IAX2 account through the account creation wizard in the both client (KDE and GNOME).
By doing this, you will be able to call other account registered to the same server.
Registered to this kind of account, you will be able to test your headset by dialing *100

ECHO test
--------
Dial *100, on sip.sflphone.org
